# farrell-skin-reflectance-plotting-tool
This project provides a Jupyter Notebook for modeling and visualizing skin reflectance spectra using Farrell's diffusion theory. It includes functions to load spectral data, calculate optical properties, and plot reflectance spectra by varying physiological parameters. Ideal for quick and easy visualizations for those doing skin imaging research.
